Image Classification Algorithms 

- Image Classifcation 
- Challenges 
- semantic gap - the inherent disconnect between how humans and computers interptet images
- object/image variations an image classification system should be to handle and tolerate
   - Viewpoint variation
   - Scale variation
   - Deformation
   - occlusions
   - illumination
   - background clutter 
   - intra-class variation
 
Types of learning 
- Supervised learning 
- Unsupervised learning 
- Semi-supervised learning 

Image Classification pipeline 
##Dataset of Images ---> Training/Testing Split ---> Feature Extraction ---> Training classifier ---> Evaluate Classifier
- Structuring your initial dataset. 
- Splitting the dataset into two (optionally three) parts.
- Extracting features.
- Training your classification model.
- Evaluating your classifier.

Algorithms
- KNN
- Logistic
- SVM
- Trees
