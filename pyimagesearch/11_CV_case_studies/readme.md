When the image is at a distance of 2ft(24 inches) and has shape of height and width as (4in * 4in). We can calculate the **Focal Length** of the camera by taking a photograph and measuring the pixel width of the object (here it is 101 pxl)  

F = (P * D) / W  

P - apperent width of the pixels
D - depth
W - width

F = 101*24/4 = 606
